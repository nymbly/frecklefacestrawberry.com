			  				<h1>About the Author</h1>
			  				<p>
				  				Julianne Moore is an award-winning actress and the
				  				author of the Freckleface Strawberry series. Freckleface Strawberry was her nickname when she was 7
				  				because she was covered in freckles and had very
				  				red hair. She hoped that they would go away when
				  				she grew up, but they didn't.
				  			</p>
							<p>
								Julie lives in New York City with her husband, her two
								children, and two black dogs. She is also the author of
								MY MOM IS A FOREIGNER BUT NOT ME, to be
								released in September 2013. She is still afraid of dodgeball, but she is not afraid of the dark.

			  				<h1>About the Illustrator</h1>
			  				<p>
			  					LeUyen (pronounced Le Win) Pham grew up with no
				  				freckles. But she always loved them on other people.
				  				She started to draw as soon as she could walk, and
				  				hasn't stopped since. She has illustrated over 50 books
				  				for children, as well as writing a few of her own. Her
				  				books include the New York Times Bestselling GRACE
				  				FOR PRESIDENT by Kelly DiPucchio, GOD'S DREAM by
				  				Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Alvin Ho series by
				  				Lenore Look, as well as her own BIG SISTER LITTLE
				  				SISTER and ALL THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT YOU.</p>
	
				  			<p>
				  				She lives in San Francisco with her husband (who is
				  				also an artist) and her two ridiculously adorable little
				  				boys (no freckles on any of them!).
