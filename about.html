                            <p>Once upon a time there was a little girl who was just like everybody else. She was seven. She was short. She could ride a bike. She was just like everybody else, except for one thing. She had red hair. And something worse...FRECKLES!</p>
                            <p>Meet Freckleface Strawberry: a red- haired and frecklefaced 7-year-old girl who's learning to love the skin she's in. Because after all, the things that make you different also make you YOU.</p>

                            <h1>About the Author</h1>

                            <p>Julianne Moore is an Academy Award-winning actress and the New York Times bestselling author of the FRECKLEFACE STRAWBERRY series. Freckleface Strawberry was her nickname when she was seven because she was covered in freckles and had very red hair. She hoped that they would go away when she grew up, but they didn't.</p>
                            <p>Julianne lives in New York City with her husband, her two children, and two black dogs. She is also the author of MY MOM IS A FOREIGNER, BUT NOT ME. She is still afraid of dodgeball, but she is not afraid of the dark.</p>

                            <p>LeUyen (pronounced Le Win) Pham grew up with no freckles. But she always loved them on other people. She started to draw as soon as she could walk, and hasn't stopped since.</p>

							<p>She has illustrated over 50 books for children, as well as writing a few of her own. Her books include the New York Times bestselling GRACE FOR PRESIDENT by Kelly DiPucchio, GOD'S DREAM by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Alvin Ho series by Lenore Look, as well as her own BIG SISTER, LITTLE SISTER and ALL THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT YOU.</p>

							<p>She lives in San Francisco with her husband (who is also an artist) and her two ridiculously adorable little boys (no freckles on any of them!).</p>
