                        <p>Freckleface Strawberry and its owners, publishers, artists and licensees ("we" "our" "us") is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This policy (together with our Terms &amp; Conditions and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By submitting personal data to www.frecklefacestrawberry.com and any of our affiliated web sites (each a "Website" and together the "Websites") you consent to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of such personal data in accordance with the provisions of this privacy policy.</p>

                        <h4>Information we may collect from you</h4>

                        <p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our Website. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our Website, subscribing to a service provided by us, purchasing publications through our Website, posting material on or to our Website or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by us or another company in our group of companies, and when you report a problem with our Website.</li>

                            <li>When you register to receive newsletters we request the following date: your name, email address country. You can update any of your personal information in the newsletters section of the Website at any time.</li>

                            <li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>

                            <li>We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</li>

                            <li>Details of transactions you carry out through our Website and of the fulfilment of your orders.</li>

                            <li>Details of your visits to our Website (including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Cookies</h4>

                        <p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that can be put on a web users' hard disc to distinguish one user from another and improve their experience. We may use cookies to collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. Our website uses 5 cookies which can be divided as follows:</p>

                        <p>Session cookies (2) - these allow the Website to link your actions during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what you have put in your shopping basket as you browse the Website. These session cookies expire after a browser session so would not be stored long term.</p>

                        <p>Persistent cookies (3) - these are stored on a user's device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering users' preferences and choices when using a site.</p>

                        <p>We also use 8 third-party cookies (i.e. cookies that are set by another domain other than the one being visited by the user) from Twitter - 3 session cookies and 5 persistent cookies.</p>

                        <p>The cookies we use enable us:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>to estimate our audience size and usage pattern;</li>

                            <li>to store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site according to your individual interests;</li>

                            <li>to speed up your searches; and</li>

                            <li>to recognise you when you return to our Website.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Pursuant to the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (SI 2011/1208) we require you to agree to the above referred to cookies. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site. For further information see <a href="www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

                        <p>Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.</p>

                        <h4>Where we store your personal data</h4>

                        <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of an order placed by you via the site, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and, to the extent that such transfer is within our control, with the relevant protections required by law in place.</p>

                        <p>Our site is accessible via the internet and so may potentially be accessed by anyone around the world. Other users may access the site from outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). This means that where you choose to post your data on our site, it could be accessed from anywhere around the world and therefore a transfer of your data outside of the EEA may be deemed to have occurred. You consent to such transfer of your data for and by way of this purpose.</p>

                        <p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>

                        <p>The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
