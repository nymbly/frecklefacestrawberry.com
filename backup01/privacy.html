		  				<p>Freckleface Strawberry and Flip & Lucky, LLC ("we" "our" "us") is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This policy (together with our Terms & Conditions and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

						<h4>Cookies</h4>
						<p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that can be put on a web users' hard disc to distinguish one user from another and improve their experience. We may use cookies to collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. Our website uses 5 cookies which can be divided as follows:</p>
						
						<p>Session cookies (2) - these allow the Website to link your actions during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what you have put in your shopping basket as you browse the Website. These session cookies expire after a browser session so would not be stored long term.</p>
						
						<p>Persistent cookies (3) - these are stored on a user's device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering users' preferences and choices when using a site.</p>
						
						<p>We also use 8 third-party cookies (i.e. cookies that are set by another domain other than the one being visited by the user)  from Twitter - 3 session cookies and 5 persistent cookies.</p>
						
						<p>The cookies we use enable us:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>to estimate our audience size and usage pattern;</li>
							<li>to store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site according to your individual interests;</li>
							<li>to speed up your searches; and</li>
							<li>to recognise you when you return to our Website.</li>
							</ul>
							
						<p>Pursuant to the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (SI 2011/1208) we require you to agree to the above referred to cookies. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site. For further information see www.allaboutcookies.org. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
						
						<p>Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.</p>
						
						<h4>Where we store your personal data</h4>
						<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of an order placed by you via the site, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and, to the extent that such transfer is within our control, with the relevant protections required by law in place.</p>
						
						<p>Our site is accessible via the internet and so may potentially be accessed by anyone around the world. Other users may access the site from outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). This means that where you choose to post your data on our site, it could be accessed from anywhere around the world and therefore a transfer of your data outside of the EEA may be deemed to have occurred. You consent to such transfer of your data for and by way of this purpose.</p>
						
						<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
						
						<p>The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
						
						<h4>Uses made of the information</h4>
						<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.</li>
							<li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, or to allow selected third parties to do
							  the same, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.</li>
							<li>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us. To the extent that carrying out such obligations necessitates us
							  disclosing your personal information to agents, contractors or other third parties involved in the performance of contracts entered into between you and us,
							  you agree and consent to such disclosure.</li>
							<li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.</li>
							<li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
							<li>In order to comply with any of our legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
							</ul>
						
						<p>You will not receive unsolicited marketing communications from us and/or from third parties selected by us unless you have agreed to this. We may, however, contact you from time to time as necessary with information or queries about your registration, your purchases and/or your postings.</p>
						
						<p>We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users. We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
						
						<h4>Disclosure of your information</h4>
						<p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>
						
						<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>In the event that we sell or buy any business (in whole or in part) or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or
							  buyer of such business or assets and may sell and transfer personal data collected through the site in connection with and pursuant to the sale of any such
							  business or assets.</li>
							<li>If Freckleface Strawberry's assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred
							  assets.</li>
							<li>To the extent necessary to enable us to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.</li>
							<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and
							  Conditions and other agreements; to operate our systems properly; or to protect the rights, property, or safety Freckleface Strawberry and Flip & Lucky, LLC,
							  its subsidiaries, affiliates, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud
							 protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
							</ul>
						
						<h4>Your rights</h4>
						<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by choosing not to check certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at emailfreckleface@frecklefacestrawberry.com and asking us to cease contacting you for such purposes.</p>

Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
						
						<h4>Access to information</h4> 
						<p>The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of $25 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
